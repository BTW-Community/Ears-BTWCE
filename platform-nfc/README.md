# Ears Platform New Frontier Craft

This is a platform implementation for Ears targetting the Beta 1.7.3 retrofork, New Frontier Craft.
It uses the agent-vlegacy Common target.

NFC contains a more complete skin fix than most retroforks, with secondary skin layer support and
slim model support. It used to lack slim model support and translucent secondary layer support, but
it now has them. This is the most straightforward retrofork port as a result; only Ears features
needed to be added.
