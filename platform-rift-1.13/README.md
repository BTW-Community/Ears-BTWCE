# Ears Platform Rift 1.13

This is a platform implementation for Ears targetting Rift 1.13.2. It uses the mixin-modern Common
target.

Rift is long since unmaintained, and all the required dependencies for building mods using it have
slowly fallen off of Jitpack and become unbuildable due to the death of JCenter. This port uses
my own forks of [Rift](https://github.com/unascribed/Rift) and [RiftGradle](https://github.com/unascribed/RiftGradle).
