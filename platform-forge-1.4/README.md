# Ears Platform Forge 1.4

This is a platform implementation for Ears targetting Forge 1.4. It uses the agent-vlegacy Common
target.

1.4 is before coremods and mods were merged. Ears contains various patches, so this is a coremod.

As I have a soft spot for 1.4 and play it regularly, this is the only legacy port that enjoys Tier
1 support.

The old MCP-based tools for Forge 1.4 no longer work without a ton of work, so this is based on a
fork of Fabric Loom with a complex history called
[Voldeloom](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/voldeloom).
