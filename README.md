# Ears
***Faithful fancy fashion features for fuzzy folk.***

 

Created due to a lack of the [Tails](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tails/) mod for 1.16, Ears is a simple mod that adds three additional regions to the player skin. Ears Front, Ears Back, and Tail.

The Ears areas are 16x8 and render flat centered above the player's head, and the Tail renders rotated near the base of the back of the player's torso. Unlike Tails, all these regions are purely 2D, and have a somewhat more vanilla-faithful appearance as a result.

 

Here's a skin template:

The Ears Back area is rotated 90Â° due to limited space in the skin texture. The blue square on the middle left indicates to the mod your skin is intended to use Ears. The blue square is at 0, 32 and needs to be the exact color #3F23D8 and 4x4.

 

 

Better documentation or maybe videos coming soon. Be happy I'm even releasing this.
