# Ears Platform Forge 1.5

This is a platform implementation for Ears targetting Forge 1.5. It uses the agent-vlegacy Common
target.

1.5 is before coremods and mods were merged. Ears contains various patches, so this is a coremod.

The old MCP-based tools for Forge 1.5 no longer work without a ton of work, so this is based on a
fork of Fabric Loom originally created by TwilightFlower for 1.4 called
[Voldeloom](https://github.com/unascribed/voldeloom/tree/1.5.2).
