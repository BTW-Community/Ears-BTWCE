# Ears Platform Forge 1.2

This is a platform implementation for Ears targetting Forge 1.2. It uses the agent-vlegacy Common
target.

1.2 is before coremods were introduced, so this is based on a Java agent despite a modloader being
present.

The old MCP-based tools for Forge 1.2 no longer work without a ton of work, so this is based on a
fork of Fabric Loom originally created by TwilightFlower for 1.4 called
[Voldeloom](https://github.com/unascribed/voldeloom/tree/1.2.5).
