# Ears Platform Better Than Adventure / Vanilla Beta 1.7.3

This is a platform implementation for Ears targetting the Beta 1.7.3 retrofork, Better Than
Adventure. It uses the agent-vlegacy Common target.

BTA is a fairly minimal jarmod, as far as rendering and skins go, compared to NFC and NSSS. The only
change it currently makes is changing the skin URL to point to Betacraft's proxy. As such, this
port also works on vanilla Beta 1.7.3 or with ModLoader.
