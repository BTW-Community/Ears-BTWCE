This is a platform implementation for Ears targetting Forge 1.6. It uses the agent-vlegacy Common

This is the oldest version of Minecraft that still has working contemporary tools. ForgeGradle 1.0
is fragile nowadays, but Voldeloom wasn't easy to port due to the changes made to Forge to make way
for ForgeGradle.
