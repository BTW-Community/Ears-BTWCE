# Ears Manipulator

This is the code and dependencies for the Ears Skin Manipulator, a browser-based skin previewer and
Ears magic pixel editor. It's built on three.js.

ears-common.js is a symlink into the Common build; you must use `build.sh` with no arguments or
`./gradlew clean build closure` in the common directory in order for the Manipulator to work.
